# Task_5
#Task 5: Elevate Labs: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#1: Data Loading:
  .info(),.describe(),.value_counts()
#2: visual exploration
  sns.heatmap(),sns.pairplot(),histograms(age,fare),boxplots(age,fare),scatterplot(age vs fare)
#3: observations
  Writtern insights for each visual to interpret trend and anomalies
#4: Summary
  Key findings:
    Survival rate vary significatly accross passenger classes.
    Age and afre show some correlation with survival
    Higher fare passengers tend to have higher survival rates
    Younger passengers show slightly higher survival rates
    there are outliers in fare and age distributions
    correlation heatmap show moderate relationship between features
